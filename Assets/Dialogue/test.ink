You can't remember how you got here. The room feels cold and sterile. A metal door stands in front of you, with a keypad.

*3. Knock on the door.

=== TryToOpen ===
You enter a random code into the keypad, hoping for the best. The door unlocks, and you step into a long, dimly lit corridor.

-> END

=== LookAround ===
You search the room but find nothing of interest. The walls are bare, and the floor is cold. You return to the door.

1. Try to open the door.
2. Knock on the door.

=== KnockOnDoor ===
You knock on the door, but there's no response. It's as if you're completely alone.

You make your choice, and the story comes to an end. What happens next is up to you.
-> DONE
